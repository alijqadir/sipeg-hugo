abstract: >-
  October 2025 has been a month of intense great-power activity. Under President

  Trump’s second administration, the United States finds itself paradoxically divided at

  home and assertive abroad. Domestically, the federal government has been shut down

  for over a month; internationally, Washington continues to project military power in

  the Caribbean Sea and the Middle East, while Trump’s recent visit to ASEAN

  countries seeks to project a peacebuilder’s image. This duality, instability within,

  activism abroad, has not gone unnoticed. Western media and scholars have begun to

  contrast this paradoxical American moment with China’s apparent stability and

  strategic clarity. It is within this context that China’s 15th Five-Year Plan

  (2026–2030) and the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) assume

  particular significance.
