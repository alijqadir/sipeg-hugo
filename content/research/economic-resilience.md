### Fiscal Stabilization with Social Safeguards

Pakistan’s macroeconomic recovery depends on credible fiscal reforms paired with targeted social protection. SIPEG modelling assesses the multiplier effects of subsidy rationalization and productivity-oriented spending.

### Trade and Investment Diversification

To navigate global realignments, exporters must deepen value-add segments in textiles, agritech, and services. Strategic use of special economic zones and diaspora capital can underwrite this diversification.

### Building Resilience

- Accelerate renewable energy integration to trim import bills.
- Deploy digital finance to widen SME credit access.
- Coordinate climate adaptation financing with national resilience goals.
