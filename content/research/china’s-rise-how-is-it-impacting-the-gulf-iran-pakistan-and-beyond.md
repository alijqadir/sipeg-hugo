abstract: >-
  In the past three decades, China’s rise has evoked diverging interpretations
  of

  how its ascent as a global superpower is impacting or could impact relations with the Gulf

  and Middle East. Issues of security and energy have become pivotal as China embarks on its

  ambitious “One Belt and One Road (OBOR)” policy. China has opted to craft a proactive

  and robust cultural, economic and military policy towards the region. China is pursuing this

  within the framework of neoliberalism and in subtle ways re-shaping it. In this broad

  regional context, this article focuses on how the Gulf States, Pakistan, Iran in particular,

  and India in general, are adapting to China’s rise. Do they perceive China as an

  “imperialist power” with “hegemonic designs”? Is it fear, rivalry, and conflict that China’s

  rise is evoking among Iran, Pakistan and India? Or is it the prospects of new economic,

  military and cultural ties that could enhance opportunities for peace, cooperation and

  development that are changing the geopolitical dynamics of Iran, Pakistan and India? This

  article will explore some of these questions and themes.

This article argues that OBOR(renamed as Belt and Road Initiative-BRI) is China’s counter containment strategy, with three fundamental differences that it links development with security; it has promoted economic

drivers, such as trade, investment, infrastructure, and intertwined these by redefining the

political economy of development and security. Second, it also brings in cultural and

educational exchanges as manifestations of its developmental strategy. Third, it envisions

regional connectivity, interdependence and cooperation as drivers of development and

security. OBOR is an ambitious initiative which it involves 65 countries, 4.4 billion people

and 40% of the global GDP. China has envisioned and designed the architecture of

OBOR in a manner that it addresses cultural sensitivities, economic needs and security

concerns of the participant states. Given this thrust, China is redefining the parameters of a

‘new economic geography’ by adding an element of security to the equation. In addition to

factors such as trade, knowledge production and exchange, technological prowess and

transportation costs, security acts as a pivotal determinant of the geography of development.

Based on this understanding, China’s imagination of the scale and size of infrastructure

development challenges traditional concepts. It is able to build on its talent of appropriate

engineering skills and complements this with the political will to pursue it. As Harvard

Professor F. Warren McFarlan, has aptly observed: “China is a land of engineers—they

love to build things and they are very good at it. Their progress on infrastructure projects in

the last couple of decades is remarkable.” The OBOR is China’s blue print for reviving the

ancient Silk Route into an energized and grandiose New Silk Road.
