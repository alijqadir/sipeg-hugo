abstract: >-
  Pakistan	was	born	as	a	pluralist	society	and,	in	reality,	continues	to	be	vibrant	and	

  diverse—ethnically,	linguistically,	culturally	 and	in	 terms	 of	 the	understanding	 of	

  these	aspects.		Yet,	over	the	past	four	decades,	security	imperatives	of	the	state	and	

  governing	 elites	 have	 attempted	 to	 change	 this	 reality	 into	 a	 monolithic	 society.	

  This	 has	 created	 a	 constant	 schism	 between	 state	 building	 and	 nation	 building	

  processes.	Increasingly,	the	proponents	of	monolithic	ideologies	have	captured	the	

  state.	Resultantly,	pluralist	dimensions	of	the	society	are	not	being	shored	up	by	the	

  state.	 The	 paper	 will	 examine	 how	 the	 decisions	 of	 governing	 elites	 have	 shrunk	

  pluralist	space	in	Pakistan	and	continue	to	threaten	its	pluralist	character.	Yet	the	

  society	 is	 changing	 and	 becoming	 more	 diverse	 and	 multi	 cultural	 and	 the	

  governing	 elites	 appear	 hesitant	 in	 recognizing	 and	 comprehending	 the	 scale	 of	

  this	change.	The	role	of	the	state	in	constructing	knowledge	and	narrative	is	widely	

  recognized.	 Given	 this	 context,	 the	 paper	 will	 argue	 that	 the	 18th	 Amendment	

  offers	 a	 tremendous	 opportunity	 to	 reshape	 and	 revive	 pluralist	 character	 and	

  articulate	 responsible	 citizenship	 through	 civic	 education	 in	 Pakistan.	Would	 the	

  governing	elites	seize	the	moment	and	realign	monist	state	to	Pakistan’s	pluralist	

  reality?

This	paper	is	divided	into	 four	parts.	 In	 the	 first	part,	 I	would	like	 to	provide	a	

conceptual	 framework	 of	 the	 Pluralist	 Society	 and	 its	 key	 components.	 In	 the	

second	 part	 I	 will	 examine,	 analyse	 and	 contend	 that	 Pakistan	 was	 born	 as	 a	

Pluralist	Society	and	in	 reality	 continues	 to	 be	 vibrant	and	 diverse--	ethnically,	

linguistically,	culturally	and	in	 terms	of	understanding	of	all	 these	aspects.		Yet	

over	the	decades,	security	imperatives	of	the	State	and	the	governing	elites	have	

been	venturing	to	change	this	reality	into	a	monolithic	society.	This	has	created	a	

constant	 schism	 between	 the	 state	 building	 and	 the	 nation	 building	 processes.	

While	 the	 schism	 persists,	 the	 proponents	 of	 monolithic	 ideologies	 have	

captured	the	state	and	the	pluralist	dimensions	of	the	society	are	curbed	and	not	

nurtured by	 the	 state.	 In	 the	 third	 part	 I	 will	 identify	 and	 briefly	 explain	 ten	

decisions,	 which	 over	 the	 years	 have	 shrunk	 pluralist	 space	 in	 Pakistan	 and	

continue	 to	 threaten	 its	 pluralist	 character.	 This	 interplay	 and	 propensity	 for	

monolithic	 ideology	 and	 Pluralism	 has	 adversely	 impacted	 the	 process	 of	

education	 in	 general	 and	 particularly	 led	 to	 the	 construction	 of	 an	 intellectual	

narrative	that	promotes	state	building	over	nation	building.	The	governing	elites	

have	 favoured,	 pursued	 and	 adopted	 policies	 that	 exclude	 plurality	 and	

encourage	 monolithic	 narrative	 about	 Pakistani	 state	 and	 society.	 	 It	 is	 in	 this	

context	 that	 I	 find	 that	 over	 the	last	 four	 decades	 the	 civic	education	 and	 civic	

virtues,	which	 are	 critical	 responsibility	 of	 the	 state	 and	 are	 being	 guided	 and

driven	by	ideological	considerations.	

Finally	 in	 the	 light	 of	 these	 observations	 and	 analysis,	 I	 tend	 to	 see	 18th

amendment	 as	 a	 tremendous	 opportunity	 to	 reshape	 and	 revive	 pluralist	

character	of	Pakistan	and	in	that	conte
