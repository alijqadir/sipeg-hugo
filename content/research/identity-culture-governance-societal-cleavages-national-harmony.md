  From Official Islam to Islamism: The Rise of Dawat-ul-Irshad

  and Lashkar-e-Taiba;

  This study explores the complex relationship between Islam and nationalism in Pakistan, focusing on the rise of

  Dawat-ul-Irshad and Lashkar-e-Taiba. The paper examines how these religio-political groups impact Pakistani

  society by fostering social networks, articulating religious and political ideologies, and promoting a culture of religious  zealotry.

This STUDY VENTURES to highlight the relation between Islam and

nationahsm in Pakistan. These two notions may appear self-

contradictory since Islam transcends the frontiers of nation states-

including Pakistan.At the same time, the ideology of Pakistan has been

built on the basis of the Muslim identity of the followers of Islam

inhabiting the territories of British India.This pzadox is even more

evident from the discourse of the Islamist groups which are gaining

momentum in Pakistan, especially in Punjab.

In the last decade or so, Lahore, Gujranwala (Murdike)  and Multan

have developed into a triangular circle ofannual religious congregations

and international conferences. Jhang is the other significant centre for

similar congregations. According to credible newspaper reports and

independent observers, the Tablighi Jamaat's annual congregation at

Raiwind is considered the second largest congregation of Muslims

after the Haj. It is attended by 2 million participants, while the

Lashkar-e-Taiba’s annual congregation is attended by 1 million parti-

cipants.The Anjuman-e-Sipah-e-Sahaba and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi’s con-

gregation in Multan had an attendance of 5,00,000. Similarly, the

Jamaat-i-Islami’s annual congregation in Lahore is attended by 5,00,000

participants. In a country with a population of over 130 million, an

annual turnover of 4 million people on religious congregations is not

a large but significant number. It is interesting to note that the social

class base of the Tablighi Jamaat’s participants is most diverse. They

come from all over the country, low- and middle-income groups are

preponderant, but the rich and prosperous are also visible in the

congregation. Punjabi, Pakhtun and Mohajir presence is conspicuous.

The participants include traders, merchants, petty government offi-

cials, high-ranking public officials, professionals (engineers, doctors,

educationists), businessmen and industrialists. By contrast, Dawat/ Lashkar-e-Taiba congregations are dominated by the lower-middle

classes, peasants, traders, merchants, petty government employees and

mostly young men fiorn various parts of Punjab and some from

NWFP. How should one interpret these congregations aed the

expansion of religio-political groups? These annual congregations

perform several functions. First, they provide an opportunity of social

networking and solidarity among the participants. Second, the leaders

of these religious groups use it as a forum to send their political and

religious messages across.Third, these annual congregation3 also serve

as important indicators of the size and support base of each religious

group and its organizational skills. Fourth, the Lashkar-e-Taiba uses

these congregations to narrate success stories of the jihad (holy war)’

and for sharing experience of waging ‘holy wars’ in different parts of

the world.They have a motivational purpose, because they explain the

bravery, sacrifice and success of martyrs. Fifth, they promote the

concept ofthe Muslim ummah, as a significant number ofparticipants

from other Muslim countries also attend these congregations. Last,

these congregations are ranked as important inrernationaI media

events. This paper will first propose a definiton of the notion of

religio-political groups, then it will examine the rise of such groups

under Z.A. Bhutto and during the Afghan war and finally it will focus

on the Dawat-ul-Irshad and Lashkar-e-Taiba. It wilI show that

Pakistan’s ditficulties in establishing a national identity have remained

the same while, since the 1970s. the country has experienced a shift

from official islam to islamism.

Religio-political groups are very much like any other interest group.

In most cases their membership is open and encourages formal and

informal association. They articulate the interests of those who are

associated with them and aim to influence the public policy process

and the government. However, a distinguishing characteristic of religio-

political groups is that they are not restricted by the boundaries of

interest or ethnicity alone, but also rely on cultural and ideological

affinity among the members. Thug these are groups of association,

solidarity and belief.The Pakistani case reveals that in their orientation,

outlook and interpretation of religion and its role in society, they may

have divergence and variation emanating &am the philosophies of

their respective schools of fiqahlsect. But their basic thrust is doctrinal. slam is presented as the panacea of all ills that confront Muslim

societies in general and Pakistan in particular. Therefore, their broad

goal is to establish the supremacy of the Koran and enforcement of the

Shariah (Islamic law). Most Pakistani religio-political groups regard

territoriality as manifested through the State, supeiGcial and transient

for a community of believers. At best, they see the State as an instru-

ment to transform society according to their doctrine of Islam. They

claim to promote fellow feeling and unity among believers, i.e. the

ummah. Their primary target is society, and they aim at the

tzmsformation of society through imposition of Islam and the

doctrinal world-view that they expound.

Religio-political groups are vehicles for social networking. They

f&l an important associational function. In them, besides practice and

preaching ofreligion,individuals with shared interests and orientations

band together. Like any other associational activity, membership

with& a religio-political group also produces awareness about one’s

identity. By function and association, they restrict the formation of a

pluralistic society One relates, interacts and reinforces one’s identity

not only within a group, but also in opposition to other groups.

Religio-political groups also influence the process of identity

formation Negating Islamic identity is equated with opposing PaI&

scan. Consequently, the liberal and progressive manifestations of

Pakistani identity have remained underdeveloped and weak. Over the

years, the religio-political groups have become not only militant in

responding towards imagined or real enemies-the ‘West’ or ‘India’-

but have also become the champions of ‘Pakistani ideology’. In this

new sense, Islamic sentiment in Pakistan is instrumentalized by

organizing the jihad and Mujahideen for Kashmir, Afghanistan and

other ‘Islamic causes’. A number of religious groups invoke the

concept of jihad to show support and solidarity for the ‘Kashmir

freedom fighters’.

Religio-political groups and their existence is not a new phenomenon

in Pakistan.They have been existing and playing a role in social and

political life since 1947; what is certainiy new is their political activism,

in some cases militancy, and most important, their rapid expansion in

the country. Currentlx there are 58 registered religious political parties

and 24 armed religious militias. Similarly, deeni madrasas (reIigious

schools) have also been in existence for centuries, but what are new are

their proliferation, sectarian overtones, expansion in support base,

diverse and ambiguous sources of funding.

What are the forces and factors that have triggered political activism

among the religious groups? The immediate causes of religious

political activism in contemporary Pakistan can be traced 6om three

sources. First, the policies of the State towards religion and especially

Zia’s Islamization policy; second, extraneous factors, particularly the

Iranian revolution (February 1979) and the Soviet intervention in

Afghanistan (December 1979). Second, these events were turning

points and had considerable influence in intensifying the demands and

p&&s of Islamization in Pakistan, viz., enhancing the role of the State

in giving direction to religious discourse in the country.Third, it was

in the context ofthe Iranian revolution and Soviet intervention that in

the West Islam began to be viewed largely through a ‘security lens’. It

was the American policy response to these events which fostered the

perception that Pakistan was a ‘eondine state’. It was in pursuance of

this broad goal that America evolved a policy of ‘dual containment’,

i.e. containing Iran and the Soviet Union. To attain this goal, it en-

couraged Pakistan to forge an alliance among various religious factions

in Afghanistan.The result was the emergence of an 1 l-party coalition

under the umbrella of the Hi&e Islami, under the leadership of

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (Co&y). From its inception to degeneration

(the Geneva peace process in 1987), this alliance worked in close

association with religious organizations in Pakistan, particularly the

Jamaat-i-Islami and the military regime of Zia-ulLHaq (Mushaid

Hussain). In short, the collaboration between the US and Pakistan

was instrumental in forging unity among various Afghan groups and

religious groups in Pakistan. The American policy intellectuals

promoted a favourable policy environment and gave legitimacy to

these Afghan warriors by using the metaphor ‘Mujahideen’-those

who were fighting a holy war against the infidels.This metaphor had

an effect not only on the popular consciousness of Afghans, but also

gave a boost to the revival of Islamic sentiments among the religious

groups in PakistarxThus, by the 1980% Islam had come on centre stage

as a powerful political as well as cultural and religious force, affecting

the political thinking and feeling of virtually all elements of the

population, not only in Pakistan, but in a large number of Muslim

societies (Esposito).

These developments provided the military regime in Pakistan an

opportunity to not only provide patronage to the religious groups,but

also to develop an institutional linkage that lent legitimacy to their

functioning.

Here, it may be useful to give a snapshot view of the interplay of

religion and politics in Pakistan in the framework of the current

Constitution (Shafqat).During the civilian government of Zulfikar Ali

Bhutto (1971-7), religious groups developed into a potent opposition

force. In his pronouncements and policy choices, Bhutto oscillated

between socialist, developmental&t rhetoric and Islamic symbolism.

These professions and policy outcomes produced contradictory trends:

first, a compromise on the formulation of a Constitution. The 1973

Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic, with Islam as the

religion of the Srare.Thus, foundations for enforcing the shariah and

the potential of giving legitimacy to religious groups were laid. The

size and representation of religious political parties in the parliament

was insignificant, but given the nature of debate on ideology and

dismemberment of Pakistan, they played a role larger than their size in

the making of the Constitution. The 1973 Constitution has more

Isla& clauses as compared to previous Constitutions. It carried

references to the Islamic way of life, compulsory teaching of the

Holy Koran, Islamiat, and encouraged learning of Arabic. It gave a

commitment to promote the institution of zakat, organize mosques

under the Auqaf department, and declared that no law repugnant to

the Holy Koran and Sunna would be adopted.

Second, the social and cultural permissiveness of the Bhutto regime

and a popular tilt towards ‘folk Islam’ rather than ‘high Islam’ prompted

the religious groups to accelerate demands for Islamization (Gellner).

The third important element of the 1970s was the formation of

JUI-NAP coalition governmen~ts in the NWFP and Baluchisran.

Although the duration of these coalition governments was short

(1972-3), the provincial governments were able to embark on

symbolic policies of Islamization (e.g. respect for the Ramadan

Ordinance).This encouraged other religious groups to demand greater

Islamization of laws and policies. After itz dismissal from the govern-

ment, the JUI leadership played upon the idea that had their

government been allowed to continue they would have introduced

more Islamic laws. It is in this context that Jamaat&Islami continued

to press for declaring the Ahmadiyas a minority, vociferously criticized

the socialist policies of Bhutto, insisted on enforcement of the shariah,

declared Bhutto a ‘k&r’ and demanded his ouster. Thus, during the

Bhutto years, despite socialist rhetoric and social and cultural per-

missiveness, religious issues remained a potent political force.

Fourthly, Bhutto’s holding of the Islamic Summit in 1974 brought

Islam to tentre stage, and gave a new life to religious groups and Islamic political parties. The Bhutro regime’s Islamic rhetoric, songs,

symbols and calls for the ummah’s unity created a euphoria for Islamic

revival and unity of the ummah (the gathering of heads of Islamic

States), captured the imagination of the people, 2nd~ created an

environment of expectancy for Islamic unity and possible Islamic social

order. In his speech as Chairman of the Summit, Bhutto evoked

images of Islamic glory, its great tradition, its principles of justice,

equity, fairness in the comity of nations and a desire of unity among

the Muslim States. He made a passionate appeal before the heads of

Islamic States to work for evolving a regional block ofMuslim States-

a ‘Muslim Commonwealth’.

In an age when no nation can sustain its insularity, at a time when com-

munications and economic forces are serving to promote larger groupings of

nations and countries, we owe no apology for the reassertion of the common

affinities amongst the countries of the Muslim world. It is time that we

translate the sentiments ofIslamic unity into concrete measures ofcooperation

and mutual benefit. (Bhutto 1980)

The speech, the gathering and its reportage by both the print and

electronic media had a deep impact on popular consciousness. Last, in

1974, the religious groups succeeded in getting the Ahmadiyas

declared as a minority. This declaration gave a new sense of confidence

to religio-political groups. In subsequent years, they became more

vociferous in demanding Islamization, while the PPP regime under

Zulfikar AIi Bhutto slowly and gradually succumbed to these demands.

Despite these conciliatory gestures, Bhutto could not win the co&

deuce of the religious groups, which perceived him as secular minded

and not a practising Muslim. Therefore, between January and July

1977, the religious groups not only built an alliance against the Bhutto

regime, but waged a one-point agenda of enforcing Nizam-e-Mustafa

(i.e. enforcement of the shariah). As Bhutto announced holding of

national elections in March 1977, the religio-political groups announced

a coalition against his regime. They formed the Pakistan Nation+

Alliance (PNA). The coalition consisted of nine parties, but, the

Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat-ui-Ulama-e-Islam dominated it.

These elections were held in an atmosphere of distrust, hostility an<

political confrontation. The PPP emerged as the winner, but the

opposition parties alleged that the elections were massively rigged.

The government failed to prove its innocence of these charges; thus

between March and July 1977, the PNA movement brought the

demand of Islamization to the core of Pakistan politics. The movemen! paralysed the government-traders, merchants, the Tuleba of deeni

madrasas, Jamaat-i-lslami workers and students, protested in the urban

centres in Punjab and Karachi-the army intervened and dislodged

the Bhutto Government (Richter).

Bhutto claimed that the PNA movement was not a ‘desi’ (indigenous)

but ‘an international conspiracy’, implying that it had American sup-

port, because his government pursued an independent foreign policy.

He had embarked Pakistan on a nuclear progr-e and worked for

the unity of the Islamic ummah, therefore the US Government

provided material and intellectual support to the movement. He

alleged that the US, the army and the religious groups acted in concert

to overthrow his government (Bhutto, 1979).

In subsequent years, the policies of the military regime under Zia,

its close collaboration with the religious groups-particularly the

Jamaat;i-Islami and the explicit US support to the military regime-

were to give weight to Bhutto’s argument. Additionally, as noted

earlier, the Iranian revolution and Soviet intervention in Afghanistan

changed the fortunes of the Zia regime and the religious groups,

particularly the Jamaat-i-Islami, which showed eagerness in supporting

the Afghan jihad under US patronage.

Zia’s virulent de-Bhuttoization campaign in the post-1977 period

weakened the liberal/socialist socio-political groups, which were in

,their infancy and had already suffered setbacks under Bhutto. To

counter the perceived threat Gem the PPP, the Zia regime allowed

exceptional scope to the religious groups, particularly to the Jamaat-

i-Islami for a return to active politics in the universities, colleges,

labour unions and other organizations (Nasr).This arrangement got a

,further boost with President Reagan assuming power in 1981, and the

US policy towards the Soviet Union and using the Islamic groups to contain the Soviet Union became handy.

THE US-PAKISTAN RECRUITMENT

&bit? TRAINING CONNECTION:

Puring the 1980$ the State expanded, its patronage and coercive

Afgh an war made it imperative for the Zia regime to gain the support

\~&i\~@vhmeer Ahmed). In the process, the State itself began to cultivate groups which could sustain Islamic fervour. Therefore, during the Zia

years, demands for restoration of democracy and imponigon of Islamic

laws grew as parallel currents, growing simultaneously but not

complementing each other.

A recent study provides graphic de&Is of how the Central Intell-

gence Agency (CIA) of the US and the Inter-Services Intelligence

Agency (ISI) in Pakistan developed a nexus with the religious groups

to sustain a military and political war effort in Afghanistan (Cooley).

This nexus was built around the concept of Islamic jihad against the

‘infidel’ Soviet forces. According to Ahmed Rashid, ‘the effort of the

two (CIA-ISI) was to turn Afghan jihad into a global war waged by all

Muslim states against the Soviet Union’ (Ahmed Rashid, 1999).

In fact, the Afghan war not only gave new life to the coercive

capacity of the State, but also provided an incentive to expand its

manipulative capaciv, The IS1 got deeply involved in the training

and recruitment ofMujahideen: it had to devise stmtegles to motivate

the Afghan groups to sustain the war. The collaborative arrangement

between the US and Pakistan relied extensively on recruitment and

training.According to Co&y, the US experts gave training to the IS1

on a broad range of tangible and intangible areas,‘endurance, weapons,

sabotage and killing techniques, communications and other skills’. It is

estimated that the US experts (the Special Forces, Green Berets, etc.)

provided over 60 skills, which in turn were imparted by the ISI to

‘Afghan holy warriors’.The military regime under Zia performed this

task ably, which further strengthened the coercive and manipulative

capacity of the State.

The CIA-IS1 collaboration in pursuit of the Afghan war had two

consequences for religio-pohtical groups. First, it led to factionalism

and fragmentation of the religious parties, because religious groups

began to jostle for procuring funds and training.This tension produced

personality-centric factions among the religious gmups.~In 1980-8,

the JUI got split into about 11 factions, whiie the JUP got divided into

5 factions (Fig. 5.1). Second, each of these factions began to centre

around a religious leader, who aimed to create his own madrasa.

Religious education and training for jihad became complementary.

The madrasas developed into sanctuaries of religious zealots and

political power. The factional religious leaders began to encourage

some form of military training, therefore, jihad was portrayed as a tool

to achieve a higher goal for the glory of Islam.Thus, for mqtivation

and mobilization, jihad was propounded as a legitimate concept to wage war against infidels. Supporting the Afghan Mujahideen against

Russia was portrayed as supporting Islam. Besides jihad, the other

consequences of the Afghan war were proliferation of portable wea-

pons, the drug trade and a scramble for donations for the madrasas.

According to Ahmed Rashid, between 1947 and 1975, about 870 new

madras were set up. He points out that in 1976-90 (14 years), 1,700

new madrasas emerged-most of these were established in 1977-88.

Factors like zakat funds, foreign donor support and Islamization

policies facilitated the expansion and growth of seminaries. In 1997,

there were 5,500 seminaries, half of them in Punjab. There is an

almost equal split between Barelvi (1,200 seminaries) and Deobandi

(1,000 seminaries), compared to some 200Ah-e-Ha&h and 100 Shia

seminaries. It is estimated that around 2,00,000 students study in these

seminaries. Through zakat funds and foreign support, these schools

have been able to procure millions of rupees as donations.These deeni

madras-as impart religious teaching and memorization of the Koran.

Those students who have middle level (eight years of education) are

allowed to take the Dam-i-Nizami course, which leads to Saanvi-i-

Allama (equivalent to Matric 10 years), Da@-i-Mutwast (Intermediate),

Daja-i-A& (B.A. level), Daja-i-Alaimia (M.A. in Arabic/Islamic

Studies).

Each madrasa has its own curriculum, which also has a tilt towards Each madrasa has its own curriculum, which also has a tilt towards its own particular sect.The 1979 education policy through the University Grants Commission(UGC) recognized these madrasas as degree

awarding institutions, However, the UGC has no control over the

curriculum of these schools. Besides religious education, rhe Daras-

i-Nizami courses offer teachings on figah (interpretation of Islam),

Hadith, Tafseer, philosophy, history and Islamic jurisprudence. Most

children come from the lower-income groups of parents who cannot

afford to send them to other government schools. Deb madrasas

provide free meals, give token stipends, provide some clothing, and

during holidays give pocket money for travel home.

The overall effect of the Zia regime’s education and other policies

was: (1) they revived religious symbolism and lent legitimacy to

religious groups; (2) they gave a new status to religious schools; which

were allowed to award degrees; (3) and they provided funding to these

schools. Thus, the religious groups made a transition from the peri-

phery to the mainstream in education and politics.

THE GENEVA PEACE PROCESS

AND PARTING OF WAYS

With the initiation of the Geneva peace process, the US began to

disengage from the Afghan war, but it was a dis~engagement without

dismantling the infrastructure that it had built for jihad against the

Soviet Union.The religio-political groups involved in jihad were not

fully convinced about disengagement, therefore the culmination of the

Geneva peace process marked the parting of ways between the US

policy makers and the ‘holy warriors’. A new phase began in the

development and orientation of the religio-political gmups. These

groups began to seek greater autonomy from the Pakistani State and

the US experts.The US once again put on the ‘security lens’, now the

religious groups were portrayed as ‘terrorists’ and ‘engines of Islamic

fundamentalism’ (Mark). In this context, the ‘clash of civilizations’ was

portrayed as being larger than its size (Huntington).Thus, the pattern

of religion and politics in Pakistan underwent a paradigm shill.

Religio-political groups began to take not only an anti-America, but

also an anti-democracy position, The changing equation in the US-

Pakistan strategic partnership brought the realization among the

religio-political groups that in the post-Geneva period the US not

only disengaged itself from the Afghan war and religious groups, but

was also hostile to those which persisted in pursuing ‘holy war’. It is  is

in the light of this paradigm shifi that one may analyse the emergence oftheTaliban in Afghanistan (1994) and the Lashkar-e-Taiba (1987) in

Pakistan.This changing equation has propped up and enlarged what

are called jihadi organization militant militias; the Lashkar-e-Taiba

makes an interesting case study of this phenomenon.

There is considerable historical, religious and theoretical literature

available on the Jnmaat-i-Islami, Tablighi Jamaat, and various factions

of the Ulema-e-Deoband. Some of these studies are rich in detail,

description and analysis. They also provide a good overview of the

interplay of religion and politics in Pakistani society (Mumtaz;

Metcalf; Esposito; M.Z. Hussain; Shafqat). However, there is little

literature that reviews the emergence of jihadi organizations. How

and why do some religious groups consider jihad as an essential and

integral component of Muslim renaissance? What tactics have they

adopted to integrate jihad with modern education? How is military

trainbg imparted? There are at least four such groups that have

ventured to synthesize religious and modern education.These religious

groups have invested heavily in education, opened up schools, colleges

and universitiesThey have even launched their own publications and

developed their web sites.The distinguishing feature of these religious

groups is that they have been able to use technology as an instrument

for expansion of Islamic education. These groups are Minhaj-ul-

Quran (Maulana Tahir-ul-Qadri), Tanzim-&E&wan, Lashkar-e-

Jhangvi, and the Dawat-ul-Irshad, the group on which we shall now focus.

Dawat-ul-Irshad/Lashkar-e-Tayaba

focus.

The Dawat-ul-Irshad Markaz was established in 1987 by two professors

from the Engineering University, Lahore: H&z Saeed and Zafar Iqbal.

The third founding father was Abdullah Azam, an Arab from the

International Islamic University, Islamabad. However,Azam was killed

two years after the creation ofthe new organization in a bomb blast in

Peshawar.

The personai history and early life of Professor Hafiz Saeed who

continues to be the principal architect of the Dawat educational system

and its militant arm, the Lashkar-e-Taiba. is indicative of the imprint

ofreligious education and how it may have influenced hi world-view.

Professor Hafiz Saeed’s family migrated from Haryana (India).At the

time of Independence, 36 members of the clan were kiJled while

migrating to Pakistan. Along with his mother, he settled in Sargodha. His mother taught him and his five brothers and sisters the Holy

Koran. His maternal uncle Hafiz Muhammad Abdullah Bahawalpuri

gave him religious education. He did his M.A. in Arabic and Islamic

Studies from Punjab University For two years, Hafiz Saeed taught

in a Saudi university, at Ryadh. Later, he returned and joined as a re-

search oficer in the Islamic Ideology Council. Subsequently, he was

appointed as lecturer in Islamic Studies at the Engineering University

He has recently retired from the university

Markaz-e-Taiba, headquarters of the Dawat, is situated on the

GrandTrunk Road at Murdike near Gujranwala. It covers an area of

200 acres.The compound was set up in 1990 with a ‘rumored price

of 18 cmres rupees’ (Khalid Ahmed). It is residential, provides trade

skills and ensures observance of the Ahl-e-Hadith school of thought.

The Markaz forbidsTV, outlaws pictures, but cassettes ofwarrior songs

are available. The religious philosophy of the group is Sunni-Ahl-e-

Haditl-orthodox and puritanicaLThe Markaz publishes a magazine,

Aldawa (Urdu), with a~reported circulation of 80,000.

The Dawar-ul-Irshad propounds a clear educational philosophy and

is vigorous in propounding its world-view. The twin principles of its

educational philosophy are developing a jihadi culture by combining

Islamic teaching, preaching with modern education, producing a

reformed individual who is well versed in Islamic moral principles

and the techniques of science and technology, to produce an alternate

model of governance and development. Second, by relying on jihad

as a skill for military training, inculcating a spirit of motivation for

waging jihad. For this purpose, jihad mythology is used as an

important tool to train the potential Mujahideens by narrating stales

of bravery, sacrifice and success of martyrs and by building faith in

martyrdom.Thus,the edifice ofthe Dawat/Lashkarreformistphilosophy

revolves around the ‘twin fields of education and jihad’. There is a

symbiotic relationship between the two: the one cannot be separated

from the other. Based on this philosophy, a Dawat university is under

construction at Markaz Dawat-ul-Irshad, Murdike. It is expected to

have five faculties, which will include economics, languages, religious

studies, computer science, and management. Boarding and lodging

facilities would be available, and Muslims from all over the world

would be encouraged to join the university.

Hafz Saeedi religious and political philosophy is challenging and

innovative.’ It has been correctly observed that jihad has varied

meanings and interpretation among Muslims from a ‘spiritual, intellect-ual struggle’ to a ‘recourse to armed warfare’. Similarly, for Western

observers, it also poses problems of interpretation and implications

(Sivan). Ha& Saeed provides yet another interpretation which is both

problematic and challenging. He postulates a complementarity between

holy war and education. According to Hafiz Saeed (Ekbeer, August

1999):

Isiam propounds both Dawa and Jihad. Both are equally important and

inseparable. Since our life revolves around Islam, therefore both Dawa and

Jihad are essential. we cannot prefer one over the other. This was also the

practice of the Prophet (PBUH). Ifb li fi

e e and morais are not reformed, Dawa

aone develops into mysticism and Jihad alone may lead to anarchy Therefore

recognizing the salience of Dawa and Jihad, the need is to fuse the two

together. This is the only way to bring about change among individuals,

society and the world.

Thus, the distinguishing characteristic ofthe Lashkar is its emphasise

on integrating tabligh with jihad. The two are portrayed and pro-

pounded as inseparable. Hafiz Saeed further contends that jihad and

modern education are intertwined. He reminds Muslims that when

they ‘gave up Jihad, science and technology also went into the hands

of others. This is natural. The one who possesses power also com-

mands science, the economy and politics.’

So jihad is presented as a military skill and essential for political

power.Among the reiigio-political groups, Dawat-ul-Irshad is clear in

advocating that modern education does not con&t with religious

education: the two need to be merged. It strongly propounds teaching

of modern management, computer sciences and communication

along with religious education. Modern technology should be used

and adopted to pursue Islamic education and for providing military

training.This concept ofjihad on one hand gives a boost to training

and education, and on the other declares armed warfare as a legitimate

goal It does have seeds of popular appeal and motivation.

Hafiz Saeed maintains an analytic distinction between ‘Islamic

politics’ and ‘democratic politics’. He maintains that politics is a vital

component of Islam, but that the Western concept of democracy and

elections is un-Islamic. Hafiz Saeed is clearly guided by considerations

of powerTo him, politics means control over people, ‘harnessing their

capabilities and evolving an efficient administrative machinery’. Dawa

and jihad perform these tasks; this is Islamic politics; it enhances

the potentialities of Muslims. It is in this framework that he rejects

Western democracy and propounds that politics must lead to har-nessing people’s capability and administrative e5ciency. Politics must

have a purpose and a sense of direction, Obviously, he believes that

Western democracy does not ii&l this basic purpose.

He calls for reviving Islamic spirit:

Muslims should not change according to changing circumrtances,inrtead they

should revert the circumstances towards Islam. Those who have abandoned

Islamic p&tics and adopted democratic politics and attempted to merge

Islamic politics with the former, they changed themselves. They could not

bring any change in society, they lost in the process.We are strict and rigid in

our approach therefore we stand commitred to our fundamentals.

Pursuing this logic, Hafiz Saeed defines fundamentalism and says:‘unless

one strictly adheres to one’s belief? only than one can build faith in

one’s basic principles and convictions. We are convinced that with-

out strictly adhering to our beliefs we cannot bring any meaningful

change. Islam does not absorb unislamic ways, it reforms these. Our

problem is that we keep on bringing unislamic ways into \[the] Islamic

system, therefore Islam becomes restricted.’ He does have a puritanical

approaih and asserts that ‘the need is to save the Ummah from this

dangerous trend.We need to arrest this trend and instead of adopting

other systems must restructure the entire system on Islamic principles.’

It is in this spirit that he focuses on the ‘twin fields of education and

jihad’ to bring about a transformation in Pakistani society in particular

and Muslim societies in general. The basic direction of the Dawat/

Lashkar is clear that without military training, education is meaningless.

Therefore, training has a special place in the workings of the Lashkar.

Training of Mujahideen is done in two stages.The trainers are also

divided into two categories: ordinary trainers and specialist trainers.

The first stage of training of ordinary trainers comprises 21 days. But

before this training, the trainees are asked to go in the society for

15 days on a Dawa tow, where they are expected to preach others.

Then there is a three-month waiting period, after which a character

evaluation and assessment of the trainees is made from the people of

the area. After about four months of evaluation and assessment, the

second phase of training starts.This training imparts skills in warfare

and guerrilla tactics: how to throw a bomb, how to operate a rocket

launcher, carry loads and march through mountainous areas, the tactics

of guerrilla warfare.This training combines three months of religious

and commando training.

The Lashkar-e-Taiba claims that the trainee-Mujahideen are recruited

from all social classes. Some are rich and Prosperous, others belong to he middle classes and a large number are of humble social origins.

These people are genuinely motivated to fight against the intidels and

create an Islamic order. Dawat does not regard Osama bin Laden as a

criminal and does not support American and Saudi policy towards

him.

In 1998, the Lashkar revealed that during 1993-7,lO of its leaders

were martyred in the Kashmir jihad (8 were from Punjab, 1 from Swat,

1 from Afghanistan). Punjabi recruits dominated the Mujahideen

fighting in the Kashmir jihad. Upon return from various jihads, the

Mujahideen narrate their stories in front of congregations, where these

are received with respect and admiration.

CONCLUSION

The foregoing analysis indicates that the role and significance of

religio; has undergone radical transformation in Pakistan.The number

ofreligious groups and deem madrasas has multiplied. Their congregations

and conferences have also become more regular and visible. Some of

these groups are prolific in pamphleteering Islamic publications.The

lower- and middle-income groups, particularly in Punjab, seem to be

more vulnerable to Islamic causes, symbols and this jihadi culture.This

transformation is visible and pronounced, but does not necessarily

mean that it could be converted into an expandable support base or

‘vote bank’.

The Lashkar-e-Taiba asserts that a return to the Islamic system is

the only choice, and that it provides a tiesh model of education and

Muslim renaissance which will revive Islamic spirit. Through edu-

cation and jihad, the Lashkar appears to be ‘reconstructing’ an Islamic

identity Hafiz Saeed argues that the Lashkar is playing a major role in

transforming Pakistani society: through its educational institutions, it

is producing a new breed of Pakistanis.These men are semi-educated

but motivated to wage ‘holy war’.The Lashkar leadership is correct in

diagnosing that people are alienated with the present political system,

but this alienation does not mean that they are eager to accept the

alternative that the Lashkar-e-Taiba offers.

From the point of view of the Pakistani nation-building process,

&mist movements such as the Dawat-ul-Irshad/Lashkar-e-Taiba play

a rather ambivalent role. On the one hand they put a stress on the

equation between Islam and Pakistan and on the other hand they

promote transnarional activities on behalf of Islam, an activitywhich

is bound to blur the identiN and the frontiers of the nation state.

Building bridges between the transnational aspirations of such islamist

movemenfs and the demands of nation-building is becoming a daunr-

ing task in Pakistan.
