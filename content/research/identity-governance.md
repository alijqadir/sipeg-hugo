### Evolving Narratives

Through archival analysis and contemporary discourse mapping, SIPEG researchers trace how identity frames influence public expectations of the state. The study highlights points of convergence between civic nationalism and faith-based narratives.

### Institutional Pathways

Reform initiatives require deliberate alignment across federal, provincial, and local institutions. Case studies from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reveal how administrative experimentation is reshaping citizen engagement.

### Implications for Cohesion

Investing in inclusive curricula, digital public services, and open data transparency can dilute ethno-sectarian polarization while reinforcing trust in governance.
