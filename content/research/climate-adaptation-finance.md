Pakistan’s frontline districts face escalating climate impacts without commensurate financing. This paper evaluates blended finance structures and district-level absorption capacity, identifying regulatory reforms that can unlock concessional capital.

Key findings underscore the need for resilient infrastructure pipelines, climate-smart agriculture investments, and localized monitoring frameworks that build trust with funders.
