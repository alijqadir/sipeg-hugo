This policy describes the information collected through SIPEG’s website, newsletter tools, event registration workflows, and contact forms. By using these services, you consent to the practices outlined below.

## Information We Collect

- **Contact forms.** When you complete our contact or partnership forms, we collect your name, email, phone number, organization, and the message you provide.  
- **Event registrations.** RSVP forms request attendee information plus optional organization and role data so we can issue calendar invitations.  
- **Newsletter subscriptions.** Substack collects your email address and engagement metrics (opens, clicks) on our behalf. Refer to Substack’s privacy statement for details.  
- **Website analytics.** We use privacy-respecting analytics to understand aggregate traffic patterns (page views, referrers, device type). No personal data or behavioral advertising cookies are stored.

## How We Use Your Data

- Respond to inquiries and partnership requests.  
- Send confirmations or calendar invites for events you opt into.  
- Share research updates, newsletters, or event announcements if you subscribe.  
- Improve website performance and understand which resources are most useful.

We do **not** sell or rent your personal information.

## Third-Party Services

- **Google Workspace / Apps Script.** Processes contact and event form submissions, stores entries in Google Sheets, and triggers official calendar invites.  
- **Substack.** Hosts our newsletter and manages subscription preferences.  
- **GitHub (Giscus).** Powers the comment system below research/blog posts; interacting with comments requires a GitHub account and is governed by GitHub’s privacy policies.  
- **Video-conferencing platforms (e.g., Zoom).** Registrations made via SIPEG may be synced with event platforms solely to deliver access links.

Each third party maintains its own privacy controls; review their documentation for more details.

## Data Retention & Security

- Form submissions are stored in protected Google Drives with access limited to SIPEG’s core team.  
- Event registration data is retained for up to two years for reporting and stakeholder follow-up, unless deletion is requested earlier.  
- Newsletter subscriber data persists until you unsubscribe or request removal.  
- We implement role-based access, device encryption, and periodic audits to safeguard data.

## Your Choices

- **Opt out of emails.** Unsubscribe directly via Substack or email [info@sipeg.org](mailto:info@sipeg.org) for manual removal.  
- **Request data deletion.** Contact us to delete your contact form, event registration, or comment data.  
- **Limit cookies.** You can block analytics cookies through your browser without affecting access to our research.

## Updates & Contact

We review this policy annually and when launching new products. Material updates will be dated and posted on this page. Questions or requests can be sent to [info@sipeg.org](mailto:info@sipeg.org).
