Repository access: select alijqadir/sipeg-hugo.

Permissions (repo): Contents: Read and write (also set Metadata: Read).

Save and copy the token.

In DecapBridge dashboard, edit your “Site” and replace the PAT with the new one.

If your default branch is main, also set branch: main in static/admin/config.yml.

Hard-reload /admin and try publishing again.

If the repo is in an org with SSO, make sure the PAT is authorized for that org.
