description: "Our standards for research, review, attribution, and corrections."

## Editorial Principles

1. **Accuracy before speed.** Every piece of research, analysis, or commentary published by SIPEG is reviewed by an internal editor for factual integrity, structure, and clarity. Data points, figures, and quotations must be verifiable via trusted sources.  
2. **Independence.** SIPEG maintains analytical independence from donors, advisory board members, or collaborators. Funding arrangements are disclosed when they directly influence a publication or event.  
3. **Plurality of voices.** We seek diverse viewpoints from academics, practitioners, policymakers, and civic leaders. Editorial decisions prioritize intellectual rigor and relevance over ideological alignment.

## Review Workflow

1. **Submission / Commissioning.** Manuscripts and briefs are either commissioned or received via open calls tied to SIPEG programs.  
2. **Editorial review.** A program editor reviews structure, argumentation, sourcing, and alignment with SIPEG’s standards. Light fact-checking and sensitivity review occur at this stage.  
3. **Subject-matter consultation.** When needed, an internal or external subject expert validates technical claims.  
4. **Author revisions.** Authors incorporate editorial suggestions and certify that conflicts of interest are disclosed.  
5. **Publication.** Approved pieces move to design, web production, Substack distribution, or event packaging.

## Corrections & Clarifications

- **Factual correction.** Verified factual mistakes are corrected promptly. The article or brief receives an inline note with the correction date and a short explanation of the change.  
- **Clarification.** Where additional context is required—but the underlying facts remain accurate—we add clarifying language without removing the original text.  
- **Retraction.** Should a piece be deemed materially flawed or ethically compromised, it may be withdrawn. A retraction notice explains why the content was removed.

Correction requests can be emailed to [info@sipeg.org](mailto:info@sipeg.org) with evidence supporting the change. We aim to respond within five working days.

## Conflicts of Interest

- Authors must disclose financial, institutional, or personal relationships that might influence their analysis.  
- Editors recuse themselves from reviewing content where a real or perceived conflict exists.  
- Sponsored projects are labeled, and editorial oversight remains with SIPEG.

## Attribution & Sourcing

- Statistics, datasets, and quotes must be attributed inline or referenced at the end of the article.  
- Proprietary or restricted-use data require written permission prior to publication.  
- Interviews are on-the-record unless expressly agreed otherwise; any anonymity granted must be justified to the editor.
