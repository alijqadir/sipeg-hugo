      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s geostrategic location has made it a country of pivotal importance from the Cold War to the present day. Geography not only shapes Pakistan’s foreign policy, but also its defense considerations and strategic outlook. Its crucial position in South Asia, with its proximity to the Arabian Peninsula and access to the Horn of Africa and Central Asia, make it a strategically attractive and unavoidable state for global and regional powers. China continues to be a reliable friend and considers Pakistan a window of strategic opportunity.¹ For Russia, Pakistan could offer access to “warm waters” if Afghanistan were to gain stability, thus improving the level of trust between the two nations. India’s imminent emergence as a regional power will likely be contested by Pakistan, and the peace process between the two rivals will continue at a snail’s pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
